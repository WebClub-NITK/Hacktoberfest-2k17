They are the type of logic operators such as and , or , not , xor ,etc.
1. NOT operator = 
   it reverses its value.
   ex. 1 = 0 and 0 = 1
2. AND operator = 
   it gives true value only when both the values are true otherwise it will return false value.
   (it is product of two condition)
   1 1 = 1
   1 0 = 0
   0 0 = 0
   0 1 = 0
3. OR operator = 
   it gives true value even if any one condition is true.
   (it is a sum of two conditions)
   1 1 = 1
   1 0 = 1
   0 1 = 1
   0 0 = 0
